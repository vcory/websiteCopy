# websiteCopy

This was one of the very early projects we had to complete during the 12 week Code Nation Master bootcamp.
We had to choose a website and then recreate it as best we could.

I chose the Apple website which was quite challenging at times as they kept changing the website. It was enjoyable though and I was fairly happy with the
result.
